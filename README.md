A joint study focused on transforming Sardinia into a sustainable environment. 
The project entailed an analysis of energy consumption, an evaluation of energy production methods, 
and the identification of optimal locations for photovoltaic facilities, considering the impact of desertification and the island's terrain. 
Simultaneously, an examination was conducted on the existing public transportation system on the island, exploring opportunities for electrification. 
Both scenarios were accompanied by a preliminary cost study.
